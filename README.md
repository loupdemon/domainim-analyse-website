A few features are work in progress. See [Planned features](#planned-features) for more details.

# Installation
You can build this repo from source-
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pptx704/domainim
```
- Build the binary
```bash
nimble build
```

## Planned Features
- [ ] Open ports enumeration (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Give more control to the user by adding flags
- [ ] File output (probably CSV or JSON)
- [ ] Multiple domain enumeration
- [ ] Add more engines for subdomain enumeration
- [ ] Dir and File busting

## Others
- [x] Update verbose output when encountering errors (v0.2.0)
- [x] Show progress bar for longer operations
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add comments and docstrings

# Additional Notes
This project is still in its early stages. There are several limitations I am aware of.

The two engines I am using currently have some sort of response limit. [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com) can fetch upto 100 subdomains. [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) also randomizes the results in case of too many results. I am planning to add more engines in the future (at least a brute force engine).

It might seem that the way vhostnames are printed, it is just brings repeition on the table.

Printing as the following might've been better-
```
ack.nmap.org, issues.nmap.org, nmap.org, research.nmap.org, scannme.nmap.org, svn.nmap.org, www.nmap.org
  â†³ 45.33.49.119
    â†³ Reverse DNS: ack.nmap.org. 
```
But previously while testing, I found cases where not all IPs are shared by same set of vhostnames. That is why I decided to keep it this way.

# Known Bugs
For now, I have one known bug. In case the sites are too slow (as in doesn't respond within 20s), the program crashes with a timeout error-
```
net.nim(1475)            waitFor
Error: unhandled exception: Call to 'readLine' timed out. [TimeoutError]
```
This is not an expected behaviour since try-except blocks are used to handle this error. I am still trying to figure out the cause of this error.
