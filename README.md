# Known Bugs
For now, I have one known bug. In case the sites are too slow (as in doesn't respond within 20s), the program crashes with a timeout error-
```
net.nim(1475)            waitFor
Error: unhandled exception: Call to 'readLine' timed out. [TimeoutError]
```
This is not an expected behaviour since try-except blocks are used to handle this error. I am still trying to figure out the cause of this error.
